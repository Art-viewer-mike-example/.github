# ArtViewer Example Project

Hello everyone! Here is an example project so you can pace yourselves with your own projects accordingly. Now, there's just one of me, and you guys have whole teams! So in some cases you may be able to do more than me, but always try to move through these iterations in order. As in, don't go ham on the css on day 2 just because you _can_.

Here is [the example proposal doc for this project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYgVP8O5zVr-Jrol0irVhZSljWz8CNIbnegBEzIA_1k/edit#heading=h.dwz367p60bre). You can see that all it does is succinctly lay out what we're shooting for. This is not an essay writing contest, it's a technical document pitch, so the technical components are the most crucial here. The whole thing shouldn't take much more than an hour. And I used [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for the wireframes to show that you can really use anything you want.
