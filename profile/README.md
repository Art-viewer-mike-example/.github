# ArtViewer Example Project

Hello everyone! Here is an example project so you can pace yourselves with your own projects accordingly. Now, there's just one of me, and you guys have whole teams! So in some cases you may be able to do more than me, but always try to move through these iterations in order. As in, don't go ham on the css on day 2 just because you _can_.
